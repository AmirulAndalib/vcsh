* run-time checks for all zsh-specific stuff and make this run with /bin/sh; mostly done
** setopt etc: same
* use PROMPT_SUBST in my own prompt instead of calling buildPS1 again to make this work for everyone, not just me
* if we are within a vcsh already, only help, run and exit should be allowed
* ^d re-binding does fail weirdly once i vcsh exit
* set git config core.worktree $HOME or ../../../.. ?
* vcsh clone fails when remote is empty

* make git unignore work, edit config/ to include excludesfile = /home/richih/.gitconfig.d/<reponame>; maybe move that directory in .config, somewhere?

* vcsh remove/delete
