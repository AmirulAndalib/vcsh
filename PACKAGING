# Archlinux

AUR does not require any packaging information within this repository.

# Debian

Debian packages are provided by the author in separate branches, maintained in
the upstream repository

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu imports Debian's package automagically.

# Mac OS X

Homebrew does not require any packaging information within this repository.
A separate branch with a statically compiled manpage and release tags is
provided to ease packaging. The static manpage because Homebrew lacks Ronn;
the tag so github generates tarballs Homebrew can be pointed at.

# Anything else

If you are maintaining a package for a different distribution, please get
in touch so your work can be included in another branch, thus allowing others
to adapt it to their needs or to improve it.
