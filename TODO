# generic #

`vcsh rename`

# zsh-specific #

* Hack vcsh so it can be sourced by zsh, bash & dash
** bash & dash done
** zsh will need some emulate sh
* Use PROMPT_SUBST in my own prompt instead of calling buildPS1 again to make this work for everyone, not just me


# Once `vcsh use` works again #

* If we are within a vcsh already, only help, run and exit should be allowed
* ^d re-binding does fail weirdly once i vcsh exit
* Set git config core.worktree $HOME or ../../../.. ?
* vcsh clone fails when remote is empty

* Package for Debian


# Undecided #

* Make sure `vcsh run foo` only runs for git & gitk (maybe?)
* vcsh remove/delete
* Have an aborted vcsh clone delete the repo it tried to clone?
